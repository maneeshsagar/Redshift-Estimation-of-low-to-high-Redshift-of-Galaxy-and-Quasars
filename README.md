# Redshift-Estimation-of-low-to-high-Redshift-of-Galaxy-and-Quasars
The main objective of this project and report is to estimate low to high redshift using Artificial Neural Network and Extratreeregressor. Dr-16 dataset of SDSS is being used in this project. In this project I am comparing the performance and loses of the above two models on given dataset. After calculating the redshift from both models I am comparing the results.
